## User Experience Design
### **The Strategy Plane**

Although many events are advertised on social media, it can be difficult to keep track and keep record of them
as there is no single 'one page fits all'. As a biker himself, my client has requested this website for not only
his own personal use but for the local biking community to have easily accessible information in one place.

This website was created for client Gareth G as a 'One Stop Shop' for event loving bikers. The aim is to provide
users with a simple website that allows them to quickly find or create Motorbike Events that can be shared with
other motorcycle enthusiasts. All historical events should be recorded, although they do not have to  be displayed
 as this data will not be needed until phase two enhancements of the website.

#### Site Goals
* To increase the number of participants in Motorbike events by providing a simple, easy to use website that
contains all the details of upcoming events.
* Increase funds raised for charity by the Site owners personal motorcycle club through advertising their events
on the website.

#### User stories
* As a user, I want the main purpose of the site to be clear so that I immediately know what the site is 
intended for upon entering.
* As a user, I want to easily navigate the site and locate content quickly on any device so that I can view 
content from my mobile, tablet or desktop PC.
* As a user, I want to be able to register to the website so that I can create and manage my own events.
* As a user, I want to be able to search or filter events based on custom criteria so that I can find events
 suited to me.
* As a user, I want a way to contact the site owner so that I can have any questions I may have in 
regards to the website answered.


### **The Scope Plane**

**Features planned:**
* Responsive design.
* Website title and information on the site purpose.
* Navigation Menu (Site Wide).
* MongoDB databases to store event information and user logins.
* Login functionality.
* Logout functionality.
* Motorcycle events displayed and searchable to all users.
* Registered user event creation and management.
